 * if the combination of (x^2+y^2) is an even number it will not put a beeper and vise versa.
 * then when it reached the end of each street,it has to come back to where is started and go up one street and do the same in the second street.
 * In order to eliminate the off_by_one_bug, several procedures were put in place.
